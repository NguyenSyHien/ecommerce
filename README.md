Project Description:

This project focuses on analyzing data from a Brazilian e-commerce company to gain insights into customer behavior, payment methods, product reviews, and the geographical distribution of purchases. As a Data Analyst, the goal is to clean, process, and visualize this data to identify trends, inform business decisions, and optimize customer experience.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data

The real commercial dataset has information on 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing orders from multi-dimensions: from order status, price, payment, and freight performance to customer location, product attributes, and finally reviews written by customers. A geolocation dataset also relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/long coordinates.

Project Goals:
- Understand Customer Purchase Behavior: Analyze the frequency of purchases, types of products bought, and preferred payment methods.
- Evaluate Product Performance: Identify best-selling products with the highest and lowest review scores and those with the highest average price.
- Delivery Performance Analysis: Assess the delivery performance and how frequently orders are delivered before the estimated time.
- Geographical Insights: Map customer purchase locations to understand regional demand variations.
- Develop Actionable Insights: Provide insights through a dashboard to help e-commerce businesses improve their operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and sales strategies.

Target Audience:
The target audience for this project includes e-commerce managers, marketing, operations, sales teams and data analysts working within e-commerce businesses. They would benefit from the insights derived from this project to drive marketing and operations strategies, optimize supply chains, and improve customer satisfaction.
